# CS50x - Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my journey through the **CS50x** course offered by Harvard University. Here, I document each completed exercise and the concepts learned week by week. The course covers fundamental concepts in Computer Science and programming, with a practical approach and weekly challenges.

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to a week or a specific problem. The content is divided according to the course structure:

- **Week 0: Scratch**
  - **Concepts**: programming logic, visual blocks, and algorithms.
  - **Project**: creating a game or animation using Scratch.

- **Week 1: C**
  - **Concepts**: introduction to the C language, variables, conditions, loops, and function basics.
  - **Projects**: Hello, Mario, Cash.

- **Week 2: Arrays**
  - **Concepts**: arrays, string manipulation, and basic encryption functions.
  - **Projects**: Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher.

- **Week 3: Algorithms**
  - **Concepts**: linear and binary search, sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, etc.), algorithm complexity.
  - **Projects**: Plurality, Runoff.

- **Week 4: Memory**
  - **Concepts**: pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and memory management.
  - **Projects**: Filter (Photoshop), Recover.

- **Week 5: Data Structures**
  - **Concepts**: linked lists, hash tables, and trie data structures.
  - **Projects**: Speller, which checks for spelling errors by implementing a dictionary using data structures.

- **Week 6: Python**
  - **Concepts**: basic syntax of Python, control structures, functions, and libraries.
  - **Projects**: Mario (revisited in Python), Readability (text grade level calculation), DNA (genetic sequence matching).

- **Week 7: SQL**
  - **Concepts**: databases, SQL queries, and data manipulation.
  - **Projects**: Movies (queries on a movie database), Fiftyville (using SQL to solve a crime by analyzing database information).

- **Week 8: Information**
  - **Concepts**: network protocols, web technologies, and cybersecurity basics.
  - **Projects**: None for this week, as it is focused on theory and understanding of how the internet and data work.

- **Week 9: Flask**
  - **Concepts**: web development basics using Flask, routing, templates, and handling forms.
  - **Projects**: Finance, a stock trading application where users can buy and sell stocks and track their portfolio.

- **Week 10: Final Project**
  - **Concepts**: consolidating all concepts learned in previous weeks into a full project.
  - **Project**: An independent project where students create an application of their choice using the skills acquired throughout the course.
